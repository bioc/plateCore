\section*{Abstract}
\subsection*{Background}
High throughput flow cytometry (FCM) studies are often run in a 96 or 384-well
plate format, with different samples, controls, and antibodies-dye conjugates
present on each plate. Analyzing a plate requires tracking the contents of each
well, matching sample wells with control wells, gating each well/channel
separately, making the appropriate plots, assessing quality, and finally
aggregating the results from multiple plates to make experiment level
conclusions. This process can be a significant task using traditional
point-and-click software packages, even when multiple instances are deployed.
We developed \Rpackage{plateCore} as an R/Bioconductor packaged to make
processing and analysis of large, complex datasets easier.

\subsection*{Methods}
\Rpackage{plateCore} was used to analyze the data from a BD FACS CAP screening
experiment where 5 Peripheral Blood Mononucleocyte Cell (PBMC) samples  were
assayed for 189 different human cell surface markers. This same dataset was
also manually analyzed by a cytometry expert using the FlowJo data analysis
software package (TreeStar, Ashland OR).

\subsection*{Results}
Positive markers identified using \Rpackage{plateCore} are in good agreement
with those found using manual analysis.

\subsection*{Conclusions}
\Rpackage{plateCore} provides a reproducible, objective platform for analyzing
high throughput FCM experiments. The R/Bioconductor implementation allows
bioinformaticians and statisticians access to the data, which should further
the development of automated analysis methods.

\section*{Introduction}

While there are a number of different software packages available for analysis
of FCM data, these programs are often ill-suited to the development of new
methods needed for analyzing high-throughput FCM studies. Flow Cytometry High
Content Screening (FC-HCS) experiments generate large volumes of data, and a
systematic approach to preprocessing, gating (i.e. filtering), and summarizing
results is needed for robust analyses. Automation of these steps would allow
analysis pipelines to be robust, objective, and match the high-throughput
capacity of modern cytometers. Unfortunately, current approaches to FC-HCS
analysis are semi-automated at best, and they often require significant
subjective and error-prone manual intervention to identify cells of interest
\citep{Maecker2005}. It is therefore desirable to develop programmatic
approaches to process FCM data.

FCM packages available through the Bioconductor \citep{BIOC} project provide an
open platform that can be used by cytometrists, bioinformaticians, and
statisticians to collaboratively develop new methods for automated FC-HCS
analysis. The basic data processing tools for importing, transforming, gating,
and organizing raw FCM data are in the \Rpackage{flowCore} package
\citep{hahne2009}, and the visualization functions are in \Rpackage{flowViz}
\citep{sarkar2008ufv}. The Bioconductor model for FCM data analysis facilitates
the development of new analysis methods, since the overhead associated with
accessing and visualizing FCM data is handled by \Rpackage{flowCore} and
\Rpackage{flowViz}. The availability of \Rpackage{flowCore} and
\Rpackage{flowViz} has enabled the creation of new tools for quality assessment
of large FCM experiments, such as \Rpackage{flowQ} \citep{lemeurFQ}, and
model-based clustering and automated gating, such as \Rpackage{flowClust}
\citep{lo2008}.

We have developed an R package (\Rpackage{plateCore}) that also takes advantage
of the functionality in \Rpackage{flowCore} and \Rpackage{flowViz} to create
methods and data structures for processing large, plate-based FCM datasets.
\Rpackage{plateCore} is not designed to be a GUI driven end-user tool, but
rather to help develop a standardized platform for the analysis of FC-HCS data.
These analyses often represent a collaborative effort between cytometry experts
who generate the data and the quantitative individuals who help deal with the
large volume information. In order for this collaboration to work, the
cytometrists must have confidence in the results of the automated analysis. To
this point, we demonstrate the equality of our results to those produced by an
expert cytometrist using FlowJo.

analyses performed using existing GUI FCM tools, \Rpackage{plateCore} can
reduce the level of subjectivity associated with creating the negative control
gates and also makes it easier to aggregate multiple plates into an experiment
level object for visualization and reporting. Providing \Rpackage{plateCore}
scripts along with the raw FCM data for FC-HCS experiments helps to ensure that
analysis is transparent and reproducible.}

\section*{Materials and Methods}
\subsection*{Data}

The data analyzed in this study was part of the initial set of experiments
used to validate the BD FACS CAP platform. BD FACS CAP was designed as a cell
characterization tool to screen for the presence of a large number of different
human cell surface markers, and it was important to show that the assay was
able to correctly identify positive and negatively staining markers on a well
studied cell population, such as PBMC lymphocytes. Previously
frozen PBMC samples from two donors were analyzed on a BD FACS Calibur using BD
FACS CAP staining plates. The analysis was performed on 96-well plates with 189
different antibodies arrayed three per well in 63 test wells, along with 30
isotype control wells and three unstained controls. The complete list of BD
FACS CAP antibodies can be found at
http://www.bd.com/technologies/discovery\_platform/BD\_FACS\_CAP.asp. FCM files
for the 5 plates (two for Donor 1 and three for Donor 2), are available for
download from http://www.ficcs.org.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Analysis}

The \Rpackage{plateCore}
scripts used to perform the analysis are provided in supplementary materials.
Briefly, the FCM files were first processed using a combination of static
gates(\Robject{rectangleGate}) and data driven gates (using
\Robject{norm2filter} and \Rpackage{flowCore}) to pick out the lymphocytes in
the forward (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) channels.  The
quality of the data was then assessed by looking for fluidic events such as
bubbles, pressure drops, or large aggregates that can shift the baseline
fluorescence readings. Fluidic events can often be identified by plotting the
empirical cumulative density (ecdf) plots of FSC values for each well, and
looking for distributions shifted relative to other wells \citep{lemeur2007}.
Based on the ecdf plots, several wells were further investigated by cytometry
experts who determined that the shifts were in an acceptable range. Next the
threshold between positive and negative cells were determined using the isoytpe
controls, which provided a gross estimate of non-specific binding in the
primary antibodies. One-dimensional gates were created using using the isotype
thresholds, and these gates were applied to identify cells that are positively
stained for each marker.

An example of the progression from raw FCM data files to a completed
\Rpackage{plateCore} analysis is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:analysis}. List mode
FCS files for a single plate were read into a \Robject{flowSet} using
\Rpackage{flowCore}, and then a \Robject{flowPlate} was created by integrating
the plate annotation file with the \Robject{flowSet}. The \Robject{flowPlate}
was then compensated, data quality was assessed, and gates were set according
to a negative control. These control gates were then applied to test wells to
find cells that had specific staining in channels of interest.

In addition to \Rpackage{plateCore}, the five PBMC plates were also analyzed
using FlowJo. First, an analysis template was created where test wells and
their corresponding isotype control well were assigned to one of 30 groups.
Wells in each group had similar sets of antibody-dye conjugates, and
the expression threshold (\emph{i.e.}, isotype gate) was initially set using
the isotype control well. Data for each plate was imported into FlowJo using
the template and lymphocytes were selected using a morphology (FSC-SSC) gate.
Event data for the isotype well was then visualized on a log scale, and the
expression threshold for each stained channel was set by picking a value that
lies above the bulk of the events. For BD FACS CAP, the isotype gate are
initially set so that approximately 1\% or less of the events in the isotype
well are above the threshold. These gates were then applied to the test wells,
and the gates were moved up or down depending upon positive and negative test
well populations. If the the population of cells in positive wells was much
higher than the isotype gate, then the gate was moved up to help reduce false
positives associated with non-specific staining.  Similarly, if the isotype
gate was higher than negative samples, the gate would be moved down to ensure
that positive cells were classified correctly. The percentage of cells above
the threshold for each of the 189 antibodies was then exported for each plate.

\section*{Results}

Although this study focuses on comparing two different FC-HCS analysis methods,
it is important to consider the orignal goal of the experiment used to generate
the data when interpreting the results. BD FACS CAP was designed to provide a
standard assay platform for screening a large number of markers on many
different cell types. The validation effort for BD FACS CAP included running
the assay on well-charaterized cell types to find markers with either positive
or negative staining, and comparing these results to published cell expression
profiles in the literature. The PBMC lymphocyte staining results presented in
the following section represent one of the cell types used for validating the
technology.

\subsection*{\Rpackage{plateCore}}

Descriptions of marker expression profiles for particular cell populations in
flow cytometry often use terms like positive-negative, or bright-dim, to
qualify the amount of target present. We elected to take a more quantitative
approach to reporting BD FACS CAP results by providing the percentage of cells
that lie above the isotype gate and also the Median Fluorescence Intensity (MFI)
ratio for each of the 189 markers. We define MFI ratio as the ratio of
the median signal intensity for a specific antibody relative to the median
signal of its corresponding isotype control. A cell population with 0\%
positive cells and an MFI ratio near 1 would traditionally be classified as
negative, while a population with $\ge$99\% positive cells and an MFI ratio
$\ge$10 would be classified as positive or bright. Follow-up studies, including
single color titrations and competition experiments of markers characterized
using BD FACS CAP, show that high percent positive markers ($\ge$ 90\%) are
usually confirmed as positive, while staining in markers with a low percentage
of positive cells ($\le$ 10\%) is often the result of non-specific binding (data
not shown). Note that these percentages refer to the fraction of cells above
the isotype threshold, but this does not necessarily imply heterogeneous
staining in multiple populations.

Estimates of the percentage of positive cells versus the MFI ratio made using
\Rpackage{plateCore} for each of the 189 markers from the 5 plates are shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:mfiRatio}. There is a clear sigmodial relationship
between the percentage of positive cells and the log of the MFI ratio, even
though the different antibodies had been conjugated to different fluorophores
(either Alexa 488, FITC, PE, PerCP, APC, or Alexa 647) and matched against
different isotypes (either IgG1, IgG2, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, or IgM). Points that
are off the curve should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that
there are no problems with the test and control wells, and that the isotype
gate settings are reasonable. Detailed results for each marker are not
presented in this study, but since the majority of antibodies on the BD FACS
CAP staining plate are known to bind different leukocytes, it is not surprising
that a large fraction would be identified as positive on PBMCs. Markers such as
CD44, CD45, CD47, and CD59 are broadly expressed on lymphocytes and were highly
positive (>99\%) in this study.

Additionally, visualizations such as Figure~\ref{fig:mfiRatio} suggest that it
may be worthile to report a predicted percent positive value for each marker,
which would be based on a regression of the observed percent positive to the
log of the MFI ratio. Calculating the ratio of test well MFI versus the isotype
control for a marker is obviously easier than developing an automated approach
to isotype gating, and Figure~\ref{fig:mfiRatio} implies that the two
approaches would produce similar estimates.

the test well MFI to the corresponding isotype control on a linear scale. Cell
populations with MFIs that are close to the isotype control are often split by
the isotype gate, reflecting the range of percent positive values for MFI
ratios between 1 and 10. (\%label axis better - \% positive whats - Ryan)}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Comparison to FlowJo}

Automating the creation and modification of isotype gates made by cytometrists
analyzing BD FACS CAP data using FlowJo is challenging. Cytometrists adjust
gates based on expert knowledge about the performance of specific antibody
types and dyes, or after identifying positive or negative test samples. If the
isotype gate cut off the bottom portion of a positive cell population, then
the gate was moved down.  Similarly, if the the isotype gate included too many
cells from negative test wells, it was moved up.

The automated approach employed in \Rpackage{plateCore} determines the
threshold using isotype controls. The gate (G$_{ij}$) for isotype $i$, channel
$j$ is set according to:
\begin{equation}
\text{G}_{ij} = \max (\text{99th}_{ij} \text{, MFI}_{ij}+ 4 \text{MAD}_{ij}),
\label{isoGate}
\end{equation}
where 99th$_{ij}$ is the 99th percentile for the fluorescence signal and MAD is
Median Absolute Deviation on a linear scale. While this simple, non-parametric
method works surprisingly well for BD FACS CAP, advances in model-based
clustering methods, such as those in \Rpackage{flowClust}, should lead to
future performance improvements in automated gating. Comparisons of the
\Rpackage{plateCore} and FlowJo analysis are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pcVSman}.

FlowJo and \Rpackage{plateCore} produced very similar percent positive
estimates for markers that were clearly positive ($\ge$99) or negative (0\%).
Differences between the methods are more apparent when the isotype gate split
the population of stained cells adn the percent positive estimates were between
30\% and 70\%. If the isotype gate is near the median signal for the marker,
then small changes to the gate can dramatically change estimates of the
percentage of positive cells. This same effect can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:mfiRatio}, where estimates of the percentage of positive cells
rapidly increases as the MFI ratio goes from 1 to 10.

Examining in detail at one case where the \Rpackage{plateCore} and FlowJo
methods disagree, such as CD98 on plate 9208 (Figure~\ref{fig:disagree}),
highlights situations where our automated gating approach will fail. In this
case the marker is 86\% by FlowJo and 0\% by \Rpackage{plateCore}. The isotype
control for CD98 (well H08 in Figure~\ref{fig:disagree}) has >1\% of its events
in the FL1-H (FITC and Alexa 488) channel that are above the main population,
resulting in the automated gate being set at the 99th percentile instead of the
MFI+4MADS. Fortunately, this type of mistake can also be detected by looking
the MFI ratio plot in Figure~\ref{fig:mfiRatio}. CD98 for plate 9208 has an MFI
ratio of 5 and a percent positive value of 0\%, while other markers with a
similar MFI ratio have values near 70\%.

whose MFI is near the isotype threshold. (\%need to say what the P0907 labels

isotype well having >1\% of the events above the main population, which
resulted in the automated gate being set at the 99th\% instead of the
MFI+4MADs. (indicate that G01 is a well ID PLate0909 is a plate ID - Ryan)}
\label{fig:disagree}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Donor Variation}

In addition to identifying positively staining markers, another goal for this
PBMC BD FACS CAP screen was to find markers that showed variation in their
expression levels between the two donors. Simply performing a t-test
on the percent positive estimates for the two donors resulted in a large number
of markers with significant differences, even after correcting for multiple
tests. Most of these differences are not biologically relevant, since they
reflect the uncertainty in the placement of the isotype gate rather than
differences in marker expression between the two donors. As shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:pcVSman}, small changes to the isotype gate can have large
effects on the estimates of the percentage of positive cells for values between
30\% and 70\%. These markers will be called differentially expressed, even
though the signal levels for the two populations may be very close. Similarly,
tests for differences in fluorescence signal intensities are also often
significant due to the large number of events in cell population.

Instead of testing for differences in means, we instead used a graphical
approach classify markers are candidates for donor variation and for further
analysis. Variation in estimates of the percentage of positive cells was
modeled using a binomial (n=5), where markers that are clearly positive or
negative (0 or 100\%) have little variation and those near the isotype gate
(50\%) are highly variable (Figure~\ref{fig:donorVar}). Variation in percent
positve estimates that exceeds what is expected from a binomial may represent
biological differences in the donors. The expected and observed variations in
the percentage of positively stained cells for the 189 markers in this study
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:donorVar}. Discounting CD98, which had an unusual
isotype control, the markers with the most variation (S.D. near 30\%) were
CD85, CD97, CD154, CD184, and CD252. Since CD85, CD97, CD154, and CD252 are
associated with activated T-cells, it is tempting to speculate that this
difference represents biological variation between the two donors as opposed to
technical differences in the processing and gating of the cells.

Markers that lie above the expected line will (\%were? - Ryan) be further
evaluated using titration and competition experiments to see if these results
represent real variation between the two donors. The curve in the expected line
reflects the difficulty in gating samples whose median signal (MFI) is near the
isotype cutoff, since the percentage of positive cells calculated can shift
dramatically with small changes in the gate. (standard deveiation of what? mean

\section*{Discussion}

Our approach to this PBMC BD FACS CAP study relied on processing the raw data
in parallel using both FlowJo and \Rpackage{plateCore}. FlowJo allowed the
ctyometrists to thoroughly investigate individual wells, and gave them
confidence that the \Rpackage{plateCore} results were correct (see
Figure~\ref{fig:pcVSman}). Using \Rpackage{plateCore}, we were able to reduce
the level subjectivity in setting isotype gates, eliminate mistakes associated
with manual export and merging of plate output, and automate the creation of
plots and data quality reports that summarized the experiment. Additionally,
the \Rpackage{plateCore} scripts and experimental annotation can be shared with
other cytometry groups, allowing them to reproduce our analysis.

In addition to subjective gating, the lack of a standard format for describing
large FCM experiments also makes it difficult for anyone other than the
original experimenter to replicate an analysis. (You could add something about
MIFlowCyt here as well, as even if people had a format to follow, unless they
put all the data in necessary to understand, just having a format isn't enough
- Ryan) The development of mechanism to bundle experimental metadata
descriptions with FCS data files should make it easier to access metadata in
future FCM studies, but currently this information is typically provided either
as spreadsheet or a pictorial layout of a 96 well plate. Since the creation of
\Robject{flowPlate} requires users to make a standard sample annotation file,
plate layouts from \Rpackage{plateCore} can then be easily shared along with
the raw FCS2.0/3.0 files. The standard format for \Rpackage{plateCore} sample
annotations provides a convenient way to manage the plate metadata associated
with complex FC-HCS experiments.

%moved from methods
While this same analysis can be performed relatively quickly in 
other FCM software packages, it can be difficult to reproduce the gating
decisions made by a single expert user. (Expand - Ryan)

Markers that are expressed on a small subset of lymphocytes, or markers that
are dimly expressed, would not be found with this screening approach.
(Expand - Ryan)

Since, BD FACS CAP was designed as screening tool to 
identify markers for further analysis, false negatives were a bigger concern
than false positives. The plateCore settings were chosen to err on the side of
calling samples positive. (Why, make it clear to uninformed readers by stating
explicitly? what about for other studies? more discussion here - Ryan)

The complexity of large FCM experiments, like BD FACS CAP, highlight the 
difficulty of applying existing FCM analysis platforms to high-throughput
studies. Generating and interpreting results from this PBMC study required
extensive collaboration between flow cytometrists, bioinformaticians, and
statisticians. At various points in the analysis, each group needed to access
the raw data, annotation, and details about the experimental design. Providing
this access using stand-alone FCM platforms is expensive in terms of the price
of multiple software licenses and in time spent training statisticians and
bioinformaticians to use the programs. Fortunately the Bioconductor FCM
packages are modeled on standard data structures used for microarrays, which
should already be familiar to most quantitative individuals working on
high-throughput biological problems. We found that \Rpackage{flowCore},
\Rpackage{flowViz}, and \Rpackage{plateCore} provided an open analysis platform
that facilitated communication between the flow cytometrists generating the
data, and the computational experts analyzing the data.
