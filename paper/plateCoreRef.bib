  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) or
                  intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) can quantitate
                  antigen-specific T cell responses in settings such
                  as experimental vaccination. Standardization of ICS
                  among laboratories performing vaccine studies would
                  provide a common platform by which to compare the
                  immunogenicity of different vaccine candidates
                  across multiple international organizations
                  conducting clinical trials. As such, a study was
                  carried out among several laboratories involved in
                  HIV clinical trials, to define the inter-lab
                  precision of ICS using various sample types, and
                  using a common protocol for each experiment (see
                  additional files online). RESULTS: Three sample
                  types (activated, fixed, and frozen whole blood;
                  fresh whole blood; and cryopreserved PBMC) were
                  shipped to various sites, where ICS assays using
                  cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 peptide mix or control
                  antigens were performed in parallel in 96-well
                  plates. For one experiment, antigens and antibody
                  cocktails were lyophilised into 96-well plates to
                  simplify and standardize the assay setup. Results
                  ((CD4+)cytokine+ cells and (CD8+)cytokine+ cells)
                  were determined by each site. Raw data were also
                  sent to a central site for batch analysis with a
                  dynamic gating template. Mean inter-laboratory
                  coefficient of variation (C.V.)  ranged from 17-44\%
                  depending upon the sample type and analysis method.
                  Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells
                  (PBMC) yielded lower inter-lab C.V.'s than whole
                  blood. Centralized analysis (using a dynamic gating
                  template) reduced the inter-lab C.V. by 5-20\%,
                  depending upon the experiment. The inter-lab
                  C.V. was lowest (18-24\%) for samples with a mean of
                  > 0.5\% IFNgamma + T cells, and highest (57-82\%)
                  for samples with a mean of < 0.1\% IFNgamma +
                  cells. CONCLUSION: ICS assays can be performed by
                  multiple laboratories using a common protocol with
                  good inter-laboratory precision, which improves as
                  the frequency of responding cells
                  increases. Cryopreserved PBMC may yield slightly
                  more consistent results than shipped whole blood.
                  Analysis, particularly gating, is a significant
                  source of variability, and can be reduced by
                  centralized analysis and/or use of a standardized
                  dynamic gating template. Use of pre-aliquoted
                  lyophilized reagents for stimulation and staining
                  can provide further standardization to these
                  assays.},
