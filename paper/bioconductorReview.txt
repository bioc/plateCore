The layout of the antibody-dye conjugates on the 96-well plate is proprietary to BD.   
We agree that providing the antibody assignments makes the data much more interesting, 
but we do not yet have approval to release the layout.

I've updated the help pages so they are compatible with the latest version of flowCore.

I was not able to replicate the formatting problems since gutterPlot renders
correctly in Windows XP and in Ubuntu 9.04. In the example, the data is pretty
well behaved and they are no wells that would be flagged based on gutterPlot.
Perhaps the reviewer is referring to the compactness of the points on
the y-axis?

I was unable to find a publicly available data set where the autofluorescence correction
had a big effect. This correction isn't required for PBMCs, but it make analysis
of adherent cells (fibroblasts, stem cells, etc.) much easier. Unfortunately, 
we are not able to release data on these other cell types. Even though we can't
make a compelling case to correct for autofluorescence with PBMC data, we think it is 
important provide an example. I increased the autofluorescence in the PBMC lymphocyte
example in Figure 2 so that readers can see how the method functions.

It appears that plotting intersect filters (rectGate & normGate) is not working correctly for xyplot on
flowSets from the flowViz package. I changed the functions to use xyplot for 
flowPlates instead, and edited the text to reflect the changes. I'll investigate
why the function call fails on flowSets.

I edited the vignette so that the code use to generate the figure is in the text.
Also, I used this figure to illustrate the use of the getGroups() function.

I separated the documentation for the flowPlate constructor documentation from the flowPlate class.
The flowPlate class documentation was modeled on the flowSet-class example, providing
the slots and subset operators.

Authorship of the vignette and Description file have been updated to include
all 3 authors.
