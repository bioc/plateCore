The layout of the antibody-dye conjugates on the 96-well plate is proprietary to BD.   
We agree that providing the antibody assignments makes the data much more interesting, 
but we do not yet have approval to release the layout.

I've updated the help pages so they are compatible with the latest version of flowCore.

I was not able to replicate the formatting problems since gutterPlot renders
correctly in Windows XP and in Ubuntu 9.04. In the example, the data is pretty
well behaved and they are no wells that would be flagged based on gutterPlot.
Perhaps the reviewer is referring to the compactness of the points on
the y-axis?
