Done - 1) Add Subset help page, added "i" to only Subset on some of the samples, since flowCore only allows for a list of filters that has 
same length as the flowSet.
2) Add help pages for xyplot and densityplot for flowPlates.
3) Make overlays work for xyplot (allow for more than one frame per channel, like densityplot)
